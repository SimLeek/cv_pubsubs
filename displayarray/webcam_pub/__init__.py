Handles publishing arrays, videos, and cameras.

CamCtrl handles sending and receiving commands to specific camera (or array/video) publishers
VideoHandlerThread updates the frames for the global displayer, since OpenCV can only update on the main thread
get_cam_ids gets the ids for all cameras that OpenCV can detect
pub_cam_thread continually publishes updates to arrays, videos, and cameras
np_cam simulates numpy arrays as OpenCV cameras
